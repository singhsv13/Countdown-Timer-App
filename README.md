# Countdown Timer App

This is a simple Countdown Timer app built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

1. Developed a responsive Countdown Timer web app using React and Tailwind CSS, showcasing proficiency in front-end development and UI design.
2. Implemented critical features such as customizable countdown input, dynamic start, reset, and optional pause functionalities, highlighting expertise in interactive web application development.
3. Utilized contemporary web development methodologies for an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experience, demonstrating skills in responsive design and accessibility.
4. Exhibited expertise in React state management, useEffect hook, and Tailwind CSS styling, emphasizing a comprehensive skill set in modern JavaScript frameworks and styling technologies.

## Approach
1. Project Setup:

   - Set up a new React project using Create React App or your preferred method.
   - Install Tailwind CSS in the project. You can follow the official Tailwind CSS documentation for installation  instructions.

2. Component Structure:

   - Create a functional component named CountdownTimer.
   - Initialize state variables (minutes, seconds, isActive) using the useState hook to manage the countdown state.

3. Timer Logic:

   - Use the useEffect hook to handle the timer logic. Set up an interval that decreases the minutes and seconds based on the countdown.
   - Clear the interval when the countdown reaches zero, and update the isActive state accordingly.

4. Event Handlers:

   - Implement event handlers (handleStart, handleReset, handlePause, handleInputChange) to manage user interactions with the timer and    
 input field.

5. Styling with Tailwind CSS:

   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling the components.
   - Style the input field, buttons, and timer text for a visually appealing and responsive design.
   - Utilize Flexbox with Tailwind CSS classes to center the entire app on the screen.
